# Nscan
Nscan is a fast Network scanner optimized for internet-wide scanning purposes. It has it's own TCP/IP stack and uses Raw sockets for sending TCP SYN probes. Nscan doesn't need to set SYN Cookies to check if received packets is a result of it's scan, and that's what makes Nscan faster than other similar scanners.
